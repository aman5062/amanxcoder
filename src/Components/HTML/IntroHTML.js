<p> HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental language used to create web pages. It provides the structure for content on the web, allowing you to format text, add images, create links, and much more. HTML is essential for building websites and web applications, and it's easy to learn and use. </p>

<h2>Markup Language</h2>
<p>A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The primary purpose of a markup language is to define elements within a document that describe its structure and format. Markup languages are essential in web development, documentation, and various other fields where structured data representation is necessary.
